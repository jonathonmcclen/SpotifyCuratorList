80,000 musicians comprise the American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada (AFM) and (CFM). We perform in orchestras, backup bands, festivals, clubs and theaters - both on Broadway and on tour. AFM members also make music for films, TV, commercials and sound recordings. As the largest union of musicians in the world, we have the power to make the music industry work for musicians. Each LOCAL has a Musicians' Referral Service which connects available musicians with talent buyers in the area (booking agents, fathers-of-the-bride, restaurant/hotel managers etc.). It's easy for local members to participate in the Musicians' Referral Service. Simply complete a Solo and/or Group Musical Profile and submit with any promotional materials. Then when a call comes in, we can refer the perfect band/soloist for any special event. The AFM has existed for over a hundred years by representing and serving musicians performing all types of music in all types of venues - whether it be a young rock band from Seattle playing a one-niter in Boston, or a seasoned string quartet from Toronto providing the music for a local wedding service, the AFM is their music business partner.

We have well over 20+ years collective experience within the industry. Our mission statement is to create diversity and equality within the music industry. We're a production company that works across the country specializing in local, national and regional shows. What we do is curate shows and bring good bands together and help promote shows. We'll ask bands to draw people to shows because we're going to do the exact thing, so we aren't asking anything from you that we're not ready to do ourselves. We are not a pay to play company but rather we pay artists who have a draw. We work primarily with bands/artists who make original music and typically do not book cover/tribute artists as that is a completely different circuit.

We came into existence in 2003 when I managed the black metal band Sumeria. Since then I'92ve been steadily booking shows in the LA area and in 2007 booked my first tour. Over the next 3 years I booked hundreds of shows for The Black Castle. One of the perks of running this business is that I'92ve formed many friendships with international bands and have become the go-to guy for booking the West Coast when bands come to the US on tour. Spreading the seeds of hate and waging war against all that is holy. It should would be obvious that I will NEVER book a Christian band, so don'92t even bother asking.

Wieslaw Brennecke office@brennecke-art.eu http://www.brennecke-art.eu
The philosophy of our Agency follows the tradition of early impresarios: a smaller number of artists signifies more intensive care. The individuality of each one of our artists stands in the foreground and we promote his/her successful development. We support the artist'92s creativity and work and all aspects of the artist'92s life. We closely follow the development of the artist and tune our approach accordingly. We are of the opinion, that successful collaboration only occurs when the impresario as well as the artist himself is characterized by an initiative. We are in close contact with our artists and place great value on a friendly and professional working climate. facebook.com/brenneckeart

We are known for our roster that consists of both new and promising international and exciting national acts. We don'92t focus on genres, but rather believe in the most talented and unique artists.

We'92re different from most other cruise line agencies in a couple of important ways. First, we can arrange your contracts for you without you paying any commission or recruitment fees. Secondly, we are operated entirely by a team of former cruise ship musical directors. Get in touch with us today via our ONLINE FORM to take your first steps towards an exciting and lucrative career as a cruise ship musician. Our auditions are designed to make sure you can comfortably play the types of music you will encounter as a musician on a cruise ship gig. They are fairly comprehensive and consist of production show material, big band charts, sample entertainer charts and technical studies. We need to be confident that you are able to perform at the level the gig demands. We recruit musicians from all over the world and currently have consultants in New York, Vancouver, Melbourne, the Philippines and Ukraine. If you can'92t audition in person, we can conduct the audition via an online video call using Skype, Gmail, Facetime etc. To arrange an audition simply complete the form on the contact page and we'92ll find a time soon that works for both of us.
