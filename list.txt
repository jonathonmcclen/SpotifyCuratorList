Description: BIRP is a monthly compilation of +100 tracks that are free to stream / download. They're also available on a number of other services like Spotify, Soundcloud, Apple Music, YouTube, Deezer, etc. On top of the monthly playlist, I also run an in-site blog devoted to new music as well as act as a hub for a growing community of people that love to share and talk about music. It's my way of helping to promote all the independent bands I know and love and to give the listener a chance to get to hear something new. We no longer take e-mail submissions due to the amount of e-mails (over ~100 a day!) and it is becoming so unorganized. To handle the load and to become a bit more organized we've started using SubmitHub. If you'd like me to listen to your song, please send it via my SubmitHub page. There is a $2 fee for their submission service. You're pretty much guaranteed a response! You’re also welcome to send me physical albums/demos: PO box 6676, Paris, TX 75461.

Description: We are partnered with a network of independent, ad supported playlists, that promote songs on Spotify. We have the ability to grow artist streams and song saves via advertising. Our Spotify playlists are run by independent curators. The songs pick up streams from traditional advertising. Our advertising efforts focus on directing traffic to song(s) in the artist page instead of the playlist. Artists are still included in the playlist(s), but the vast majority of the ad traffic is driven directly to the song(s) on the artist channel. Depending on the number orders in the system the speed of the campaign will vary. Here is our price list: 1 Week PROMOTION - $200 (1 song, 1 Playlist, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 2 Week PROMOTION - $300 (1 song, 2 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 3 Week PROMOTION - $400 (1 song, 3 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 4 Week PROMOTION - $500 (1 song, 4 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth).

Description: Playlists curated with love. I am a passionate music lover and I try to find a warm, organic, timeless sound in today’s music. All Songpickr activities are 100% independent. Music picks and featured artists represent my personal taste (which is not for sale). I curate Songpickr playlists on various music streaming services, run the Songpickr Facebook page, tweet about music and concerts, share pictures on Instagram and run the Songpickr website. My motivation is to find new music and artists because there is so much good music and talent out there which is often filtered out by traditional media. I no longer accept e-mail submissions, but I have a handy link on my site for submitting music to my SubmitHub page. There is a $2 fee for their submission service. You’re pretty much guaranteed a response.

Genres: COUNTRY
Followers: 12,723
Songs: 65
Description: We are partnered with a network of independent, ad supported playlists, that promote songs on Spotify. We
have the ability to grow artist streams and song saves via advertising. Our Spotify playlists are run by independent
curators. The songs pick up streams from traditional advertising. Our advertising efforts focus on directing traffic to
song(s) in the artist page instead of the playlist. Artists are still included in the playlist(s), but the vast majority of the ad
traffic is driven directly to the song(s) on the artist channel. Depending on the number orders in the system the speed of
the campaign will vary. Here is our price list: 1 Week PROMOTION - $200 (1 song, 1 Playlist, Stream Growth, Monthly
Listener Growth). 2 Week PROMOTION - $300 (1 song, 2 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 3 Week
PROMOTION - $400 (1 song, 3 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 4 Week PROMOTION - $500
(1 song, 4 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). Contact us via our Submission Page.

Description: We are partnered with a network of independent, ad supported playlists, that promote songs on Spotify. We
have the ability to grow artist streams and song saves via advertising. Our Spotify playlists are run by independent
curators. The songs pick up streams from traditional advertising. Our advertising efforts focus on directing traffic to
song(s) in the artist page instead of the playlist. Artists are still included in the playlist(s), but the vast majority of the ad
traffic is driven directly to the song(s) on the artist channel. Depending on the number orders in the system the speed of
the campaign will vary. Here is our price list: 1 Week PROMOTION - $200 (1 song, 1 Playlist, Stream Growth, Monthly
Listener Growth). 2 Week PROMOTION - $300 (1 song, 2 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 3 Week
PROMOTION - $400 (1 song, 3 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 4 Week PROMOTION - $500
(1 song, 4 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). Contact us via our Submission Page.

Followers: 31,740

Description: We are partnered with a network of independent, ad supported playlists, that promote songs on Spotify. We
have the ability to grow artist streams and song saves via advertising. Our Spotify playlists are run by independent
curators. The songs pick up streams from traditional advertising. Our advertising efforts focus on directing traffic to
song(s) in the artist page instead of the playlist. Artists are still included in the playlist(s), but the vast majority of the ad
traffic is driven directly to the song(s) on the artist channel. Depending on the number orders in the system the speed of
the campaign will vary. Here is our price list: 1 Week PROMOTION - $200 (1 song, 1 Playlist, Stream Growth, Monthly
Listener Growth). 2 Week PROMOTION - $300 (1 song, 2 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 3 Week
PROMOTION - $400 (1 song, 3 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 4 Week PROMOTION - $500
(1 song, 4 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). Contact us via our Submission Page.

Description: We are partnered with a network of independent, ad supported playlists, that promote songs on Spotify. We
have the ability to grow artist streams and song saves via advertising. Our Spotify playlists are run by independent
curators. The songs pick up streams from traditional advertising. Our advertising efforts focus on directing traffic to
song(s) in the artist page instead of the playlist. Artists are still included in the playlist(s), but the vast majority of the ad
traffic is driven directly to the song(s) on the artist channel. Depending on the number orders in the system the speed of
the campaign will vary. Here is our price list: 1 Week PROMOTION - $200 (1 song, 1 Playlist, Stream Growth, Monthly
Listener Growth). 2 Week PROMOTION - $300 (1 song, 2 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 3 Week
PROMOTION - $400 (1 song, 3 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 4 Week PROMOTION - $500
(1 song, 4 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). Contact us via our Submission Page.

Followers: 49,641

Description: We are partnered with a network of independent, ad supported playlists, that promote songs on Spotify. We
have the ability to grow artist streams and song saves via advertising. Our Spotify playlists are run by independent
curators. The songs pick up streams from traditional advertising. Our advertising efforts focus on directing traffic to
song(s) in the artist page instead of the playlist. Artists are still included in the playlist(s), but the vast majority of the ad
traffic is driven directly to the song(s) on the artist channel. Depending on the number orders in the system the speed of
the campaign will vary. Here is our price list: 1 Week PROMOTION - $200 (1 song, 1 Playlist, Stream Growth, Monthly
Listener Growth). 2 Week PROMOTION - $300 (1 song, 2 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 3 Week
PROMOTION - $400 (1 song, 3 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 4 Week PROMOTION - $500
(1 song, 4 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). Contact us via our Submission Page.

Followers: 39,692

Description: We are partnered with a network of independent, ad supported playlists, that promote songs on Spotify. We
have the ability to grow artist streams and song saves via advertising. Our Spotify playlists are run by independent
curators. The songs pick up streams from traditional advertising. Our advertising efforts focus on directing traffic to
song(s) in the artist page instead of the playlist. Artists are still included in the playlist(s), but the vast majority of the ad
traffic is driven directly to the song(s) on the artist channel. Depending on the number orders in the system the speed of
the campaign will vary. Here is our price list: 1 Week PROMOTION - $200 (1 song, 1 Playlist, Stream Growth, Monthly
Listener Growth). 2 Week PROMOTION - $300 (1 song, 2 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 3 Week
PROMOTION - $400 (1 song, 3 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 4 Week PROMOTION - $500

“I’m not going to listen to the whole song.
In my world it’s like having a soup: I can
taste a teaspoon of the soup, I can tell if the
soup is hot, if it needs more salt, if it’s oily.
I won’t listen to a whole song; that’s a waste
of time. I listen until the beat drops and then
I can tell.”

Description: We are partnered with a network of independent, ad supported playlists, that promote songs on Spotify. We
have the ability to grow artist streams and song saves via advertising. Our Spotify playlists are run by independent
curators. The songs pick up streams from traditional advertising. Our advertising efforts focus on directing traffic to
song(s) in the artist page instead of the playlist. Artists are still included in the playlist(s), but the vast majority of the ad
traffic is driven directly to the song(s) on the artist channel. Depending on the number orders in the system the speed of
the campaign will vary. Here is our price list: 1 Week PROMOTION - $200 (1 song, 1 Playlist, Stream Growth, Monthly
Listener Growth). 2 Week PROMOTION - $300 (1 song, 2 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 3 Week
PROMOTION - $400 (1 song, 3 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 4 Week PROMOTION - $500
(1 song, 4 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). Contact us via our Submission Page.

youngest nationally syndicated radio host in the country. Not too shabby for a first job huh? So, stay tuned (and patient)
as I navigate the ups and downs and share this crazy journey of becoming a real-life adult.

Description: We are partnered with a network of independent, ad supported playlists, that promote songs on Spotify. We
have the ability to grow artist streams and song saves via advertising. Our Spotify playlists are run by independent
curators. The songs pick up streams from traditional advertising. Our advertising efforts focus on directing traffic to
song(s) in the artist page instead of the playlist. Artists are still included in the playlist(s), but the vast majority of the ad
traffic is driven directly to the song(s) on the artist channel. Depending on the number orders in the system the speed of
the campaign will vary. Here is our price list: 1 Week PROMOTION - $200 (1 song, 1 Playlist, Stream Growth, Monthly
Listener Growth). 2 Week PROMOTION - $300 (1 song, 2 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 3 Week
PROMOTION - $400 (1 song, 3 Playlists, Stream Growth, Monthly Listener Growth). 4 Week PROMOTION - $500
